🎙️ Voice-to-Text & GPT Response System

This project allows you to record your voice using a microphone, transcribe the audio into text using OpenAI’s Whisper API, and then generate an AI-based reply using OpenAI’s GPT model. It’s built in Python and is perfect for experimenting with voice-enabled AI interactions.

📁 Project Structure

voice_1/
├── record_to_text.py       # Records audio and saves it as a .wav file
├── generate_reply.py       # Transcribes audio and generates a reply using GPT
├── my_recording.wav        # Example output audio file

🧠 Features
 • 🎤 Audio Recording: Capture live voice from the microphone.
 • ✨ Speech-to-Text: Transcribe audio using OpenAI Whisper (whisper-1 model).
 • 🤖 AI Response: Generate an intelligent response with GPT-3.5-Turbo.

⚙️ Requirements
 • Python 3.8+
 • OpenAI Python SDK (https://github.com/openai/openai-python)
 • sounddevice
 • scipy (for saving WAV files)

Install required packages:

pip install openai sounddevice scipy

🔑 API Key

To use OpenAI services, set your API key in your Python code like this:

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="your_openai_api_key_here")

 💡 Make sure you have sufficient quota/balance in your OpenAI account.

📝 How to Use

1. Record Your Voice

Run this script to record audio from your microphone:

python record_to_text.py

This will create an audio file called my_recording.wav.

2. Transcribe & Get GPT Reply

Once you have the audio file, run:

python generate_reply.py

This script:
 • Sends the audio to OpenAI Whisper API for transcription.
 • Sends the transcribed text to GPT-3.5-Turbo.
 • Prints out both the transcription and GPT’s reply.

📌 Example Output

🎤 Transcribed Text:
Hello, how are you?

🤖 GPT Reply:
I'm doing well, thank you! How can I help you today?

📦 Notes
 • This project uses OpenAI’s paid APIs — make sure you have a valid payment method and active balance.
 • Audio files are stored locally as .wav.

🔐 Security

Do not share your OpenAI API key publicly or push it to GitHub. Consider using environment variables for security.
